<p>As a user, because I want to track my Workouts, I want to add new Workouts into my log</p>
<p>As a user, because I want to be able to compare my Workouts over time, I want to be able to query for Workouts over a
time range.</p>
<p>As a user, because it's impossible to make an application never close, I want my workout log available as a file. </p>
<p>As a user, because retrospectively adding exercises to my workouts is tedious, I want to be able to exercise and have that counted as a Workout</p>
<p>As a user, because I am not a number, dammit, I want Pumper to refer to me by a user-friendly name.</p>
<p>As a user, because I'm not a programmer, I want a console that allows me to recollect Workouts and log a Workout</p>
